**Hi there 👋**

🙋 Introductions - 
My name is Matt. Connect with me at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/matt-atadataco).

I founded Atalert to help companies manage the amount of information moving between teams.
Atalert manages your Slack apps and gives your entire team the ability to quickly manage, route, and resolve alerts.

If you want to try out Atalert, install it today: [Atalert.dev/install](https://link.atalert.dev/github-install).
